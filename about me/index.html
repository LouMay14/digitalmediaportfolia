You don’t know me 
I soon won’t know you 
Did I at least leave you with a feeling of love 
Or was it one of passiveness 
I suppose it doesn’t matter 
Regrets are for the living 
Those who can remember what to regret 
Grief, denial, bargaining, anger, acceptance
Your still alive 
Your heart beats, lungs pump, nerves fire 
Peak physical health 
In a week you’ll be dead 
That I must accept 
Grief, denial, bargaining, anger 
Your still alive 
You don’t see my face, I won’t see yours 
Hospice
In week your brain will be nothing 
I’ll still scream at night 
Grief, denial, bargaining
Your still alive 
Your eyes are still open, your arms still work 
I could hug you one last time 
In a week I won’t even touch your corpse 
I hope for one last meeting 
Grief, denial 
Your still alive 
You walk, your talk, you feel 
That’s alive 
Dementia is just a word 
In a week you’ll walk without falling 
I know 
Grief 
Your still alive 
You aren’t here, you don’t see
That isn’t life 
You haven’t been here for a while, I haven’t truly touched you in years 
And for that realization I mourn 
Sleep peacefully, don’t starve till I can go for sandwiches again
